# Mnist Handwritten Digits

Mnist Handwritten Digits : is deep learning model that classify the digits between 0  to 9, trained on mnist data-set for hand written digits.
there is a notebook contains all steps of training on [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and it's also contains installation of [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) on the cloud 
this repository divided into two parts
1. this part which contains the prediction model 
2. server part which hand the equations, front-end stuff and dealing with the prediction model, you could find it [here](https://github.com/xayden/mnist-client#minst-client) with steps and 
requirements for installation and run

there is a live demo you could play with here.

### **Required**
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.* 
* [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) 
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)



### **Run**
after download the project's repository and it's requirements, just run the server file using with command 
` python server.py`
